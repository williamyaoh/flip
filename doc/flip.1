.SH NAME
.PP
flip \- Unicode\-aware line\-reversal utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
flip [ ...] flip (\-\-help | \-h) flip (\-\-version | \-v)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]flip\f[] reverses the characters in each line it\[aq]s given.
If it\[aq]s called with no arguments, it reads from stdin.
Otherwise, it concatenates the contents of each file passed on the
command line before reversing the contents of each line.
.PP
\f[B]flip\f[] is Unicode\-aware and makes sure not to break apart
graphemes.
For example, the \[aq]character\[aq] "é" actually consists of two
\f[I]different\f[] Unicode code points: "e" and " ́".
Naively reversing this on each Unicode code point would result in " ́e":
not likely what you want.
The "e" and its diacritic should intuitively stay together when the text
they\[aq]re part of gets reversed.
.SH ENCODINGS
.PP
\f[B]flip\f[] only takes UTF\-8 as input/output.
If you need to work with other character encodings, use \f[B]iconv\f[]
as a filter.
.SH SEE ALSO
.PP
\f[B]rev\f[](1) Same purpose, but not grapheme\-aware, and will split
apart things that shouldn\[aq]t be split apart.
.PP
\f[B]iconv\f[](1) Utility for converting to/from various character
encodings.
