.SH NAME
.PP
flip \- Unicode\-aware line\-reversal utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
flip [ ...] flip (\-\-help | \-h) flip
(\-\-version | \-v)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]flip\f[] reverses the characters in each line
it\[aq]s given.
If it\[aq]s called with no arguments, it reads
from stdin.
Otherwise, it concatenates the contents of each
file passed on the command line before reversing
the contents of each line.
.PP
\f[B]flip\f[] is Unicode\-aware and makes sure not
to break apart graphemes.
For example, the \[aq]character\[aq] "é" actually
consists of two \f[I]different\f[] Unicode code
points: "e" and " ́".
Naively reversing this bytewise would result in "
́e": not likely what you want.
The "e" and its diacritic should intuitively stay
together when the text they\[aq]re part of gets
reversed.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Currently, \f[B]flip\f[] only supports UTF\-8 as a
character encoding for its input text.
In the future, support for more encodings may be
added.
.SH SEE ALSO
.PP
\f[B]rev\f[](1) Same purpose, but not
Unicode\-aware, and will split apart things that
shouldn\[aq]t be split apart.
